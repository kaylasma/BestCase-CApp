CS460/461 Constant Acceleration Application

CApp is an application being developed by a team of software engineering students from the University of Hawaii at Hilo, as a project for
their computer science 460 and 461 courses through the 2016-2017 school year. It is a physics application meant for solving basic equations
of motion, utilizing an algorithm developed in part by Dr. Philip Binder.

The goal of this application is to provide a way for individuals to quickly solve equations of motion without doing them by hand. The
application will also provide explanations for users who are new to physics and would like to better-understand how these basic equations
are solved.
